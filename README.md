# **Engineering Student at ENIB**

### **About Me**
I am currently an engineering student at the √âcole Nationale d'Ing√©nieurs de Brest (ENIB), where I explore the captivating fields of electronics, computer science, and mechanics. My time at ENIB has provided me with a solid, well-rounded foundation, balancing both theory and practical application.
In electronics, I've designed and implemented various circuits and systems, working with microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators to create innovative solutions for real-world problems.
In computer science, I've gained deep knowledge of programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies, particularly in embedded systems.
In mechanics, I've studied mechanical systems, dynamics, and material science, specializing in CAD (Computer-Aided Design), blending creativity with technical precision.
Throughout my academic journey, I've participated in various team projects, enhancing my collaboration and communication skills. I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies, and I thrive on the challenges that engineering presents.
